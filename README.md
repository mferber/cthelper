# Cthelper: an assistant for _Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu_

## About the app

Playing the excellent board game [_Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu_](https://zmangames.com/en/products/pandemic-reign-cthulhu/), by [Z-Man Games](https://zmangames.com/en/index/) can get a little bit confusing. This small app helps keep track of the current context.

A player's turn has multiple steps, some of which trigger additional actions that need to be carried out in full before moving on to the next step â€” especially when "Evil Stirs." As you work your way through the consequences, it can become difficult to remember where you were in the turn. ("Was that the Summoning step or Evil Stirring? Were we on the first Summoning or the second?")

Cthelper is a little app that helps keep track of the turn mechanics. Each step has three phases: a number of actions, the drawing of two cards (either or both of which can cause Evil to Stir), and two or three "summonings." Cthelper keeps track of where you are in the turn, including the correct number of actions and summonings. For actions, the player's Investigator role and sanity level are taken into account, as is the Alien Carving relic. For summonings, the current summoning rate is taken into account.

We've found this app to be a great help in keeping track of the game, making it more fun!

## Usage

Begin the app by entering the players in turn order, then tap "Begin Game."  The app will then begin prompting you through each players' turns, step by step.  At each phase, the app shows the number of actions to be done, with a counter; tap the counter or any blank area on the view to advance through the count as you carry out the prescribed actions. At the end of the Summoning phase, the next tap will automatically advance to the beginning of the next player's turn.

The "draw cards" phase doesn't really need a separate prompt for each card ordinarily, but in the rare (and unfortunate) case that a player draws two "Evil Stirs" cards, the counter will help keep track as you carry them out in sequence.

When the game is finished, just close the app!
